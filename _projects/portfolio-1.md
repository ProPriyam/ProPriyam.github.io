# The Bookworm Project: A New Era in Book Recommendations

Introducing **The Bookworm Project**, a cutting-edge multi-modal book recommendation tool that personalizes your reading journey. Unlike traditional systems that rely solely on ratings or genres, this innovative tool integrates various search modalities to enhance the accuracy of its recommendations.

By harnessing rich datasets like the **Book Crossing Dataset** and **CMU Book Summary**, along with the **Google Books API** for ISBN matching, the system effectively answers pressing questions such as "What should I read next?" and "What books are similar to a book I liked?"

Developed in **Python** with **Streamlit** for a user-friendly interface and **VoyageAI** for generating recommendation embeddings, the project boasts features like:

- Recommending books by the same author
- Identifying titles with similar plots
- Suggesting popular reads within specific genres

Currently a proof of concept with a limited dataset, **The Bookworm Project** showcases the potential of multi-modal approaches in book recommendation systems, guiding users toward their next great read without the influence of advertising.

Key engineering highlights include **semantic search** and **database similarity KNN caching**, ensuring faster and more relevant results. Dive into a world of personalized reading with **The Bookworm Project**!
